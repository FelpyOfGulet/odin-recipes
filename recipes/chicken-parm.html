        This dish is a delicious twist on a classic favorite: tender, breaded chicken breast baked with a rich tomato sauce and a layer of melted cheese, served over perfectly cooked tagliatelle. Fresh herbs add a burst of flavor and color, making it as beautiful as it is satisfying.

        Steps
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 220 °C top/bottom heat (200 °C fan oven). Heat plenty of water in a kettle. Halve the onion, peel it and chop finely. Also peel the garlic and chop finely (or use a garlic press).</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil and sauté chopped onion for 2 – 3 minutes until soft and translucent. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add the tomato sugo to the pot. Reduce heat, stir and simmer for approx. 2 minutes. Then season with salt* and pepper*.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, place the chicken breasts between 2 layers of baking paper and pound them slightly with a meat mallet (or rolling pin) until they are about 2 cm thick. Mix 50g of flour, salt and a pinch of pepper in a deep plate. In a second deep plate whisk 2 eggs. Place the breadcrumbs in a third deep plate. First coat the chicken breasts in flour, then dip them in the egg and finally coat them in breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Heat enough oil in a large pan to cover the bottom. When the oil is hot, fry the chicken breasts for 2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Then place on a baking tray lined with baking paper. Pour plenty of hot water into a large pot, add salt and bring to a boil. Cook the fettuccine for 10 – 12 minutes until al dente. While the fettuccine is cooking, go to step 5.</li>
        <li>Spread each chicken breast with 2 tablespoons of tomato sauce and sprinkle with the grated parmesan. Then bake on the baking tray in the oven for 8 – 10 minutes until the chicken breasts are no longer pink inside. Meanwhile, finely chop the parsley leaves.</li>
        <li>Drain the fettuccine through a sieve and mix with the remaining tomato sauce in a large pot. Place the pasta on a plate, place the chicken breast on top and sprinkle with parsley. Enjoy!</li>
