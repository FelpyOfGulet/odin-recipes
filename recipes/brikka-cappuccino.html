        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        This is my way of making cappuccino, it puts a great cappuccino on the table in about five to ten minutes! I have a 4 cup brikka pot, so be sure to use the correct measurements for your model.
    </p>

    <p>
        The amount of coffee will change slightly depending on the roast profile. I recommend using medium roasted beans with chocolatey undertones because they work great with the moka pot, giving a full-bodied texture with great flavour!

        Ingredients
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Coffee Beans</li>
        <li>180g of water</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>If you have an electric stove, start heating the stovetop. A moka/brikka pot isn't inherently compatible with induction stovetops, but you can still use an adapter</li>
        <li>Fill 180g of water in the bottom chamber. SAFETY NOTE: 180g of water works for my model, but may be too much for yours. Ensure there is NO water covering the valve</li>
        <li>Fill the funnel filter to the top with coffee beans or grounds, then put those in your grinder. If you are using grounds, skip the next step</li>
        <li>Grind the beans and put them back in the funnel filter</li>
        <li>Tap the funnel filter lightly (do not tamp!) and slot it back in the bottom chamber. Screw in the top chamber and put the moka pot on the stove</li>
        <li>With a brikka, as soon as coffee starts coming out, remove it from the stove. When it starts sputtering, run the pot under cold water to avoid cooking the coffee. Serve into 4 cups</li>
        <li>Froth your milk. With a hand frother, warm a cup of milk in the microwave to about 68Â°C, then froth it for about 4-5 seconds. In my kitchen, I usually need 2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>Tap the pitcher on the table to remove excess foam, then pour into the cups. Start pouring high, then quickly come down close to the cup for best results. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
